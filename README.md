Native Android app in Kotlin that retrieves the data from https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json.

Display this list of items to the user based on the following requirements:
- Display all the items grouped by "listId"
- Sort the results first by "listId" then by "name" when displaying.
- Filter out any items where "name" is blank or null.

The final result is displayed to the user in an easy-to-read list.
